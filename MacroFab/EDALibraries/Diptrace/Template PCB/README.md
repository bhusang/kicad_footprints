**Diptrace Template PCBs**

This directory contains template PCBs for creating 2,4, and 6 layer board at Macrofab.

To use the template PCB, open the file with the appropriate layer count. Within this file are the DRC rules for all 4 of Macrofab's manufacturing options.
To access the rules, go Verification -> Design Rules. In the pop up window you can select the 4 DRC options from the drop down list.

When exporting manufacturing files, the cam creation has been set up to properly output the appropriate files.
To output manufacturing files:

file -> export -> gerber -> Export all
file -> export -> DipTrace ASCII
file -> export -> N/C DRILL -> Export all

The exported files will load into the Macrofab user interface properly
