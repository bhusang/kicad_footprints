Introduction
============

3D models in STEP and VRML format for ECAD
Copyright (C) 2015,  Joan The Spark

This repo contains models in STEP & VRML of surface mount devices in SOD, SOT and other packages as well as some connectors.
They are accompanied by footprints for KiCAD.

The models are oriented so that pin 1 is at the top left most times (-X axis, +Y axis). The VRML models are scaled by a factor of 1/2.54 to be used without scaling in KiCAD. File names are the same for STEP and VRML.

License wise those are all GPLv3+ which is commented into the STEP and VRML files.
