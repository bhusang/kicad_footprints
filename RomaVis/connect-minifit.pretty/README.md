KiCad Pcbnew modules: Molex Mini-Fit-like connectors

In fact, these are modules for cheap chinese Mini-Fit-like PCB headers,
often marketed as "Mini-Fit" on ukrainian radio markets.

_Noticeable differences:_
Distance between rows of pins is 4.2mm, NOT 5.5mm (as in original Molex 5566).
In-row pitch is 4.2mm, as usual.
