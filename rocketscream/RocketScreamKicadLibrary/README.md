1. This is Rocket Scream Electronics KiCad libraries using the latest version
of KiCad (v4.0.x).

2. Enormous amount of effort has been put into this library. Most of the 
components are created from scratch based on datasheet and also some adjustment 
based on real PCB. Some components might have some slight adjustment to fullfil 
PCB manufacturer specifications and facilitate assembly process. 

3. Please take note that we DO NOT guarantee the accuracies of the library and
by using them you have acknowledged that you are using them at your own risk.
Always use a gerber viewer and 1:1 scale printout to check your PCB work.
