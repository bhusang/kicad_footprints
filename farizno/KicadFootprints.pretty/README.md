# Note: 
The Custom NoPins versions of the footprints do not have a drawing of the pins and locking tab or courtyard area for them. This is for installations where the pins and locking tabls will overhang the board edge. Be careful not to use them in boards where the pins will not overhang the edge, as it could cause conflict being as there is no courtyard for this part of the footprint.
